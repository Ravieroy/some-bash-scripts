### The repository contains a collection of some bash scripts. Few of them are basic stuffs written during learning bash scripting. Some bash scripts arose as necessity, which still are basic stuff with little more involved. 

### Following is the name and description of what the codes do. Will keep updating the codes and adding more. 

[chkX.sh](https://github.com/Ravieroy/some-bash-scripts/blob/main/Utilities/chkX.sh) : A simple script to check if the file is executable. 

[chmodX.sh](https://github.com/Ravieroy/some-bash-scripts/blob/main/Utilities/chmodX.sh): Checks if the file is executable and provides permission if it is not executable.

[mon.sh](https://github.com/Ravieroy/some-bash-scripts/blob/main/Utilities/mon.sh): Script by which you can monitor your time spent on laptop while tracking your battery. This creates a log file with all the sessions. ***you have to run the script when you power on and off your laptop***
