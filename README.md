## some-bash-scripts

----

### The repository contains a collection of some bash scripts. Few of them are basic stuffs written during learning bash scripting. Some bash scripts arose as necessity, which still are basic stuff with little more involved. 

### All the scripts are tested on Ubuntu/Debian based distros. While the basic functionality won't be affected, you might get some errors which can be corrected depending on the distro.

### Following is the name and description of what the codes do. Will keep updating the codes and adding more.
